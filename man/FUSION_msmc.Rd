\title{FUSION_msmc - Differential expression analysis of sncRNA families in multiple samples data with multiple conditions using expression matrix}
\usage{
FUSION_msmc(
  a,
  cl,
  row_mean = getOption("row_mean", "0.1"),
  sncrna_family = c("tsrna", "rsrna", "ysrna", "mirna", "other"),
  top_species = getOption("max_num", "1000"),
  padj_method = c("bonferroni", "BH")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{a matrix with first and second column as "Sequence" (or ID) and "Annotation", respectively. Rest of the columns provides RPM or expression values from different samples under study. Sequence (or ID) must be unique.}

\item{cl}{a file specifying multiple sample conditions in a comma separated format (such as for 3 different conditions with 6 samples each the file will contains the input: 1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3). Note: one can specify the condition in any order depending on the order of  the samples in the matrix, such as : “2,2,2,1,1,1,3,3,3” or “1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2” or “1,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,3,3,3”.}

\item{row_mean}{mean RPM (default 0.1) threshold to retain the sncRNA species (rows) in the matrix}

\item{sncrna_family}{list of sncRNA families to be analysis for expression analysis study. Use "tsrna", "rsrna", "ysrna", or "mirna" for tsRNAs, rsRNAs, ysRNAs, or mirna, respectively. Use "other" for 'pRNA,snRNA and snoRNA'. For all, use any letter or number, eg. "a","b", "c", 1, 2, 3. By default (i.e. if no option specified) it will search for tryRNAs (tsRNAs, rsRNAs, and ysRNAs)}

\item{top_species}{number (default 1000) of top species for each sncRNA family to be considered for analysis. It can help to reduce the run time of the analysis for the families (such as rsrna families) with large number of species. If time is not a concern, use high values such as 5000, 10000, etc.}

\item{padj_method}{adjustment methods for correcting p-values. Use either "bonferroni" or "BH", where BH stands for Benjamini & Hochberg. By default (i.e. if no option specified) it will run for "bonferroni".}
}
\value{
It will return a final output in a data-frame with t-statistics, P_value, and adjusted P_value for each sncRNA family chosen for analysis
