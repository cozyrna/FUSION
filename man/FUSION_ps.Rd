\title{FUSION_ps - Differential expression analysis of sncRNA families in paired data samples using expression matrix}
\usage{
FUSION_ps(
  a,
  row_mean = getOption("row_mean", "0.1"),
  sncrna_family = c("tsrna", "rsrna", "ysrna", "mirna", "other"),
  padj_method = c("bonferroni", "BH"),
  order = c("G", "P")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{a matrix with first and second column as "Sequence" (or ID) and "Annotation", respectively. Sequence (or ID) must be unique.  Rest of the columns provides RPM or expression values from different samples under study, such as first half of those belongs to the samples from Condition1 (such as control or from healthy tissue) and second half belongs to the samples from Condition2 (such as treated or infected tissue)}

\item{row_mean}{mean RPM (default 0.1) threshold to retain the sncRNA species (rows) in the matrix}

\item{sncrna_family}{list of sncRNA families to be analysis for expression analysis study. Use "tsrna", "rsrna", "ysrna", or "mirna" for tsRNAs, rsRNAs, ysRNAs, or mirna, respectively. Use "other" for 'pRNA,snRNA and snoRNA'. For all, use any letter or number, eg. "a","b", "c", 1, 2, 3. By default (i.e. if no option specified) it will search for tryRNAs (tsRNAs, rsRNAs, and ysRNAs)}

\item{padj_method}{adjustment methods for correcting p-values. Use either "bonferroni" or "BH", where BH stands for Benjamini & Hochberg. By default (i.e. if no option specified) it will run for "bonferroni".}

\item{order}{use either G or P for specifying the order of paired samples in the input matrix, where G is for Samples in Group (i.e. all samples from Condition1 followed by all samples from Condition2) (follow example_matrix_p1)) and P is for samples in Pairs (follow example_matrix_p4). By default it considers sample pairs in Group (G)")}
}
\value{
For each pair in the input matrix, it will return an output data-frame with w_positive, w_negative, P_value, and adjusted P_value for each sncRNA family chosen for analysis.
