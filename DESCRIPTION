Description: FUSION has two modules FUSION_ps and FUSION_ms for diferential expression analysis of sncRNA families in paired data samples (FUSION_ps) and multiple sample data (FUSION_ms) using expression matrix as input.
    FUSION_ps performs differential expression analysis of sncRNA families in paired data samples.
    FUSION_ms performs differential expression analysis of sncRNA families in multiple samples data.
    Further,to perform differntial expression analysis of sncRNA families in multiple samples data with multiple conditions using expression matrix, one can use the function FUSION_msmc.
